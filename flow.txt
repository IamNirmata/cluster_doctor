1. get free nodes list
    - save it to list ./gitignored/free.txt
2. Get latest test results timmestamp from validation.db for all the free m ( by accessing gcr-admin-pvc-access pod)
    - per node per test - latest timestamp
    - if a node has no test results - mark it as "never tested" - highest priority
3. Combine free nodes list with latest test results timestamps create a job queue list 
    - Sort nodes by latest test results timestamps (oldest first - highest priority)
4. For each node in job queue list
    - Create a job to run cluster-doctor validation tests on that node
    - Submit the job to k8s cluster
    - Log job submission status

5. Monitor job status
    - if a job pending for more than X minutes - cancel the job and log the event
    - if a job runs longer than Y minutes - cancel the job
6. After job completion ( inside job pod)
    - Collect test results log
    - Update validation.db with new test results and timestamps
    - Log job completion status

7. Generate a daily report
    - Summary of nodes tested
    - Summary of test results
    - List of nodes that were never tested
    - Save report to ./gitignored/reports/daily_report_<date>.txt
